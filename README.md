# Nexter

What is Nexter ? A misspelled tv show or a killer feature ? Not sure but it wraps your ActiveRecord model with an ordered scope and consistently cuts out the _next_ and _previous_ records. It also works with associations & nested columns : `order("books.genre, authors.name, published_at desc")` 

## Installation

    gem 'nexter'

## Usage

```ruby
@books = Book.includes(:author).bestsellers.
              order("genre", "authors.name", "published_at desc")

nexter = Nexter.wrap( @books.find(56), @books )
nexter.previous
nexter.next
```

## Use Case Full Stack

It helps you cycle consistentely through each record of any filtered collection instead of helplessly hit the back button of your browser to find the next item of your search. It plays well with gem which keeps the state of an `ActiveRelation like [siphon](https://github.com/charly/siphon), [ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack), [has_scope](https://github.com/plataformatec/has_scope) & others.

```ruby
class Book
  def nexter=(relation)
    @nexter = Nexter.wrap(relation, self)
  end

  def next
    @nexter.next
  end

  def previous
    @nexter.previous
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BookController
  before_filter :resource, except: :index

  def resource
    @book_search = BookSearch.new(params[:book_search])

    @book ||= Book.includes([:author]).find(params[:id]).tap do |book|
      book.nexter = siphon(Book.scoped).scope(@book_search)
    end
  end
end
```

```erb
<%= link_to "previous", book_path(@book.previous, book_search: params[:book_search]) %>
<%= link_to "collection", book_path(book_search: params[:book_search]) %>
<%= link_to "next", book_path(@book.next, book_search: params[:book_search])
```
